# Contribution Guidelines

we honestly at this time are open to anything. If you see something wrong, make an issue or a pull request! If you see we are missing something, make an issue or a pull request! If there is a period missing...heck, make an issue or a pull request!

A guide like this takes someone to spend the initial hours to setup and time to maintain, but the contributions of others are where things become powerful!

# 2 Rules
1. Changes/Additions must either match or maintain some level of orderly markdown styling
2. No *common* folders in the root repo directory!
   * I understand its redudent to rewrite functions over and over again, but its honestly annoying as hell to try and just copy a project folder on an example repo and realize non of the code works unless you copy over all these annoying common folder/files as well. This is ment for helping people, not to be a well oiled production set of code.

# How to contribute from GitHub.com

- Make sure you have a free GitHub.com account and you are logged in.
- Find an appropriate topic category in the [README.md](https://github.com/sjfricke/awesome-webgl/blob/master/README.md) file to add it under, or add your own if you think it is needed.
- Click the :pencil: button [Edit link](https://github.com/sjfricke/awesome-webgl/edit/master/README.md) on the top right-hand corner of the README.md. This will do two things:
  - Fork the repository to your account.
    - Create a new branch so you can send your changes in a pull request.
	- Add your changes.
	- Scroll down to the `Propose file change` box and write a commit message and optional extended description.
	- Click the `Propose file change` button.
	
	> NOTE: this works the same for any of the files
